# Explanation

This is a very simpler version of the more_complex_project.

All the files here create a single DAG. They might have @config decorators
within it, as well as @resolve... 

Otherwise there is no prefixing of the modules because the pipeline is simple.
The idea is that this is what people start with and we want to model
how this would grow and into the more_complex_project.

So see that README.md for more information and discussion.
